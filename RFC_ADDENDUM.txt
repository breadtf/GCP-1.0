	1. The Extensions header
		1.1. Syntax
	2. The OPNAME extension
		2.1 Examples

1. The Extensions header
	For a client to communicate it's supported extensions to it's peer, an extra header called "Extensions" shall be used.
	This header is sent in a CAT message during the handshake process.

		1.1 Syntax
		
			The Extensions header has a field called "Extensions", and it's value is a list of comma-separated values,
			each corresponding to a supported extension.

2. The OPNAME extension
	To use the OPNAME extension, a client must send an Extensions header that contains "OPNAME" in
	it's list of comma-separated values.

	Another header with the field of "Operator-Name" must be included, it's value is the remote system operator's name.
	The value of the Operator-Name extension must not contain an equals sign (=) or a semicolon (;).

		2.1 Examples
		
			A CAT message with the OPNAME extension and the operator name "johndoe" would look like this:
					GCP/1.0 CAT Extensions=OPNAME;Operator-Name=johndoe;
